# RMM-Catalogue

Trailing on the back of [Brokensound77](https://gist.github.com/brokensound77/6d8a1e480e65ff20e151099c98267b14)'s RMM work, and [Trend Micro's recent talk](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2023/pdf/JSAC2023_1_1_yamashige-nakatani-tanaka_en.pdf), this is an attempt to create a catalogue of all known remote monitoring and management tools.

Such tools are heavily used in eCrime operations to ensure initial access, provide persistence and to masquerade as more legitimate administrative activity.

Please feel free to admend and improve with pull requests and feature requests.
